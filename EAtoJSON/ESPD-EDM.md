# ESPD EDM JSON Schema

## Introduction

Our objective is to standardize the ESPD EDM representation and we would like to propose a JSON Schema. This will help to increase the interoperability between ESPD EDM versions.

The need for a schema came from multiple directions:

- users that want to upgrade their ESPD Service to a newer version need to migrate their preivous data to the new ESPD structure, both for ESPD Document and for Critreion.
- comparing and showing the diference between ESPD versions from business and technical point of view.
- use a common basis for technical implementations.

Starting with ESPD v5.0.0 we propose as single source of information the Enterpise Architec (EA) model. The information stored in EA project will be exported in JSON format and will facilitate the implementation and adoption process.

## JSON Schema

The full documentation on JSON schema can be found here: https://json-schema.org/.

ESPD-EDM is represented as a JSON object containing distinct (unique keys) of Exclusion Ground and Selection Criteria objects. This is the deifinition of each object only.

```
{
    C1 :{ ... },
    C2: { ... },
    ...
    C##: { ... }
}
```

The following mapping from components to object labels is used:

| Component                   | Label | UBL mapping                                   |
| --------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------- |
| CRITERION                   | C     | cac:TenderingCriterion                        |
| ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION_LINE | ADL   | cbc:Description                               |
| SUBCRITERION                | SBC   | cac:SubTenderingCriterion                     |
| LEGISLATION                 | L     | cac:Legislation                               |
| CAPTION                     | CA    | cac:TenderingCriterionProperty                |
| QUESTION                    | Q     | cac:TenderingCriterionProperty                |
| REQUIREMENT                 | RQ    | cac:TenderingCriterionProperty                |
| QUESTION_GROUP              | QG    | cac:TenderingCriterionPropertyGroup           |
| QUESTION_SUBGROUP           | QSG   | cac:SubsidiaryTenderingCriterionPropertyGroup |
| REQUIREMENT_GROUP           | RG    | cac:TenderingCriterionPropertyGroup           |
| REQUIREMENT_SUBGROUP        | RSG   | cac:SubsidiaryTenderingCriterionPropertyGroup |
| <br/>                       |       |
| RESPONSE                    | R     | cac:TenderingCriterionResponse                |
| RESPONSE_VALUE              | RV    | cac:ResponseValue                             |
| EVIDENCE_SUPPLIED           | RES   | cac:EvidenceSupplied                          |
| APPLICABLE_PERIOD           | RAP   | cac:ApplicablePeriod                          |

_CRITERION_ is used only at top level all the other elements are components. _QUESTION_GROUP_, _QUESTION_SUBGROUP_, _REQUIREMENT_GROUP_, and _REQUIREMENT_SUBGROUP_ are container structures used to organise the basic elements. The containers may be imbricated.  
The _RESPONSE_, _RESPONSE_VALUE_, _EVIDENCE_SUPPLIED_, and _APPLICABLE_PERIOD_ are used only in the response document, they are not part of the structure and they are used to distinguish between multiple occurences of the same element and for interoperability purpouse.

Each element has a counter that is incremented when the element repeats at the same level, in order to guarantee the unicity of the label. When dealing with multiple occurence of the same element for the response part the discrimination is done by incrementing the corresponding **R#** of that element. In the request part the element will appear only once.

### Top level object

For ESPD v1.X.X until v4.X.X we used to label Criterion with C## (e.g. C33) in order to identify them from techical point of view. We will keep this notation for conveninece and backwards compatibility. If a criterion was deprecated then the number was not recycled, so there are some gaps in criterion numbering. Some of the other sections from the ESPD Document were modelled as Critreion under **OTHER** tag.

Starting with v5.0.0 the **OTHER** criteria were mapped to specific UBL structures and are modelled consequently in EA. The structure for the **OTHER** will be similar to Criterion so that UI rendering should be uniform.

The keys of the top level Criterion element:

| Key             | Type                  | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### Components object

Each Criterion, Group or SubGroup contains an array of objects, some of them are just containers and at the lowest level are two types of components:

- static text for user information (CAPTION, LEGISLATION, ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION_LINE),
- user input field (QUESTION, REQUIREMENT).

The container components are used to organize and group the low level elements. The structures may be imbricated following the business logic that is imposed by grouping from Annex II.

The keys of the Components of container type (QUESTION_GROUP, QUESTION_SUBGROUP, REQUIREMENT_GROUP, REQUIREMENT_SUBGROUP):

The content of the following elements must be fetched form eCertis based on the UUID of the Criterion, and the structure of the ESPD EDM must be augmented with those details. In particular for **SUBCRITERION**:

- **LEGISLATION** corresponds to EU directives and regulations that must be observed by all ESPD participants at any moment. This is normally plain text with eventual liks to the actual legislation. User is not required to feed any particular information.
- **SUBCRITERION** corresponds to EU memeber state national legislation and specific conditions. Each EU member state may ask for extra details and documents. It might be paritculary complex to render the entire element. Please note that there are technical limitations of the ESPD EDM. If you encounter any difficulties accomodating your data structure please contact ESPD Team at: [OPESPD@publications.europa.eu](mailto:OPESPD@publications.europa.eu)

## Full ESPD Document structure

The ESPD is a document based on [Annex II of Regulation (EU)2016/7](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2016/7/oj). The overall structure is divided in **Parts**, **Sections**. Each **Section** groups information cells: Exclusion Grounds, Selection Criteria, and General Information. The JSON Schema accomodates the Exclusion Grounds and Selection Criteria. The General Information is not entirely modelled via JSON Schema, some sections are assimilated with _Other_ criterion and it might be fully described in the future ESPD EDM.

        "A": ["PI-SA"],
        "B": ["PI-SB"],

## Definitions

**ESPD Request**  
ESPD Document created by the Contracting Authority or the Buyer that will express a need for goods or services together with Exclusion Grouds and Selection Criteria.

**LOT Management**  
An ESPD Request contains at least one **LOT**. The Exclusion Grounds apply to all LOTs and Selection Critreria applies only to specified LOTs.

**ESPD Response**  
ESPD Document created by the Economic Operator as a followup of an ESPD Request. An ESPD Response is provided for each _LOT_ from the ESPD Request document. All ESPD Response documents must be assembled together and provided to the Contracting Authority or the Buyer.
