## Introduction

### Objectives of the Document and Target Audience

The Data Models and XML of the {espd} (both `ESPDRequest` and `ESPDResponse`) need the validation of the business rules defined
in the {espdDataModelDocs}.

The main objective of ISO/IEC 19757-3:2006 is to bring together different validation-related tasks and expressions to form
a single extensible framework that allows technologies to work in series or in parallel to produce a single or a set of validation results.
It is based on the {schematron} assertion language.

### Scope of this document

#### In scope
This document provides the life-cycle of validation process and the structure and layers of the {schematron} used for the
`ESPDRequest` and `ESPDResponse` process. Also, it provides a quick guide on how to expand the current process and
integrate it into a Java application for its execution.

#### Out of scope
Some of the transformation files (XSL-T) used during the process are the ones defined by {schematron}. The detailed use
of the files is not described.

## Schematron

{schematron} is a language for making assertions about the presence or absence of patterns in XML documents.
It has different usage, however in `ESPD` it is used for:

* General validation: quality control and assurance of the data;
* Code lists validation: values and code lists used for each element;
* Business rules validation.

### Life-cycle
The implementation of {schematron} is using XSL-T while taking into account the `ESPD` needs described; the application
is using the life-cycle shown in “Figure 1: ESPD Schematron - Life-cycle”.

[[img-schematron-lifecycle]]

Each of the phases are detailed in the next sections as a high-level description:

. A report with the results of the validation is created at the beginning of the validation process and is closed
(i.e. ready for submitting) at the end of the process. It contains all errors annotated during the validation process
and its success or, in case of failure, the reasons for failure and how to correct them. The report uses the
ISO Schematron Validation Report Language (SVRL).
. Any XML instance (see [ESPDRequest-XML-Files] or/and [ESPDResponse-XML-Files]) is validated against the XSD schema
(either ESPDRequest [DOC-REF-6] or ESPDResponse [DOC-REF-7]):
.. The XML follows the structure of the XSD schema;
.. The mandatory elements are included.
Due to the fact that all XML must be conforming with the XSD schema, if the validation has any error the process
finishes at this point.
. As a second step code lists and business rules are validated and all possible errors are annotated in the report
without interrupting the execution of the validation process.

### Architecture
The architecture of {schematron} varies depending on the validation process.

#### Code Lists Validation Architecture
The validation of the values and code lists used are defined in the CVA (Contact / Value Association)  file(s).
The CVA files are used for reporting the information found inside of genericode (*.gc) files.

[[img-code-list-architecture]]
image::code-list-architecture.png[title="Code List architecture", alt="Code List architecture", align="center"]

The {schematron} process transforms this CVA into XSL-T files in order to be able to execute these validations against the XML file.

#### Business Rules Architecture
The validation of the business rules used are defined in the SCH (Schematron Schema)  file(s). It contains natural-language
assertions concerning a set of documents, marked up with various elements and attributes for testing them.
The business rules implemented are the ones described in {espdDataModelDocs}.

Figure 3: Business Rules Architecture
[[img-business-rules-architecture]]
image::business-rules-architecture.png[title="Business Rules architecture", alt="Business Rules architecture", align="center"]

As can be seen in the Figure 3: Business Rules Architecture, there is a transformation process from SCH to XSL-T in order
to be able to execute these validations against the XML file.
This process is part of the process from "Code Lists Validation architecture" and described in "Figure 2: Code List architecture".

== Semantic Validation Algorithm

[[img-data-flow-diagram]]
image::data-flow-diagram.png[title="Data flow diagram" alt="Data flow diagram", align="center"]

The generated JAR file provided has the following data flow:

. The parameter needed to start the process is the following: `–xml [Path and filename of the XML File to be validated]`.
Examples: `-xml "C:/ESPDRequest_example.xml"`
. The process validates that the arguments send are correct and the file exists and it is an XML. Otherwise the process ends.
. Before starting with the whole validation process, the output folder structure is created in the local directory, next where the JAR file is located. The structure is the following:
** *Data* folder: all output reports will be created within this folder.
*** *20160422_030431* folder: data and hour of the execution of the validation.
**** *Html_reports* folder: final reports in html format.
**** *Reports* folder: final reports in XML format.
. If it is a single XML the validation process is launched one time; otherwise it is launched for each XML file within the ZIP folder.
. The validation process consists in:
.. Model detection: `ESPDRequest` or `ESPDResponse`. The validation steps are the same for each model, although some of the business rules are different.
That’s why they process must be executed separately.
.. Validation of the XML file against the XSD schema. If there is any error, it is write in the output report and the process ends.
.. Schematron validation process: validation of the code lists values, code lists attributes, identifiers business rules and other business rules.
Each of the processes generates a final report, whether the process is correct or not.
.. After the process, if it is the last XML, the process ends with a final report that includes all the reports.
The reports follows the standard {isoSvrl}.
