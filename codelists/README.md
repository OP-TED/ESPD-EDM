# `codelist` folder

This this folder contains code lists.

There are 2 types of code lists: 
- EU Vocabulary Code Lists (see: [eProcurement tables - EU Vocabularies - Publications Office of the EU](https://op.europa.eu/en/web/eu-vocabularies/e-procurement/tables)), and 
- Technical Code Lists maintained by ESPD-EDM Team. 

The EU Vocabulary Code Lists are downloaded directly from EU Vocabularies site, and the Technical Code Lists are automatically created by ESPD-EDM automation.
