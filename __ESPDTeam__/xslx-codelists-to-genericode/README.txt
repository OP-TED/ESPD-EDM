Steps to generate the GC files out from the ESPD-EDM Code Lists excel file:

1. Open the file __ESPDTeam__/ESPD-CodeLists.xlsx
2. Save it locally as "ESPD-CodeLists.xml" (Select the following filetype: XML Spreadsheet)
3. Use your preferred XLS-T transformation method and the Stylesheet "Excel_to_GC_Multilang_v1.0.xsl" as an input to generate the *.gc files (each tab in "ESPD-CodeLists.xlsx" will be transformed into a separate *.gc file)
