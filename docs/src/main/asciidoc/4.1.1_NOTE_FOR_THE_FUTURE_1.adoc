.Note for the future 1. The ESPD Service evolution: from a dynamic structure towards a dynamic one
[IMPORTANT]
====

[.text-left]
The current version of the ESPD Service user interface and XML documents instances are based on a fixed 
known structure which is very close to the requirements expressed in the http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0007[Annex to the Regulation 2016/7].

[.text-left]
This imposes limitations to the maintainability and evolution of the ESPD Service. A dynamic 
approach where the interface is built-up based on the data being imported into the 
ESPD Service is currently being addressed in order to overcome these limitations.
