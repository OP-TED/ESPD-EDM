=== Contracting Party

The class `cac:ContractingParty` was defined in UBL-2.1 (hence the prefix `cac:`).  
This UBL class is a specialisation of the the very rich UBL-2.1 aggregate component `cac:Party`. 
The ESPDResponse only uses a reduced subset of its data, although the XSD Schema imports it in 
all of its richness (so you could use it for your own purposes beyond the ones expected by the 
ESPD Service). See the http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html[UBL-2.1] specification for all 
the details about the `cac:Party` Common Aggregate Component.
