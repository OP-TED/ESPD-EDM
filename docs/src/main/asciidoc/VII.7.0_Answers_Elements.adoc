|*Class name*:|cac:TenderingCriterionResponse
|*Definition*:|A class to describe a response to a criterion property.

|*Context of use*:|The economic operator uses it in the ESPD Response document to answer a QUESTION. http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-018[_tbr92-018, tbr92-007, tbr92-005, tbr92-006_].

|*Components*|*Type*|*Card*|*Description*|*Requirements*

|*cbc:ID*
|Identifier
|0..1
|A language-independent token, e.g., a number, that allows to identify a criterion response uniquely as well as allows to reference the criterion response in other documents. A criterion response describes how an economic operators fulfills an specific criterion.
|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-018[_tbr92-018, tbr92-007, tbr92-005, tbr92-006_]

*Rule*: This ID SHOULD be provided by the EO or the service provider that instantiates the ESPDResponse XML document.

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-TCR-05, BR-OTH-02)

|*cbc:ValidatedCriterionPropertyID*
|Identifier
|1
|A cross-reference to the criterion propertys which is validated thorugh this response expressed as an identifier.
|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-018[_tbr92-018, tbr92-007, tbr92-005, tbr92-006_]

*Rule*: This ID MUST point at one of the TenderingCriterionProperty/cbc:ID that were included in the Request document.

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-RESP-30, BR-RESP-40, BR-RESP-60, BR-RESP-60-S10, BR-RESP-60-S20, BR-TCR-01, BR-TCR-03, BR-LEAD-10-S20, BR-LEAD-10-S30)

|*cbc:ConfidentialityLevelCode*
|Code
|0..1
|A code specifying the confidentiality level of the given response for this criterion.
|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-018[_tbr92-018, tbr92-007, tbr92-005, tbr92-006_]

*Rule*: If the value is true, all the evidences associated to this response becomes also confidential.

*Rule scope*: SELF-CONTAINED (BR-TCR-02, BR-OTH-01, BR-OTH-01#19, BR-OTH-03)

|*cac:ResponseValue*
|Associated class
|0..n
|A class to describe the criterion property response value.
|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-018[_tbr92-018_]

*Rule*: This class contains the main disjoint elements used to provide the actual answer. The UBL-2.2 model provides cardinality 0..n, this allows for building up lists of, namely, identifier and code values that are all "packaged" into one `cac:TenderingCriterionResponse` that in turn is linked to one `cac:TenderingCriterionProperty`. Beware that the cardinality is flexible (0..whatever) because some responses are not simple values, like the ones but complex ones, e.g. `cac:ApplicablePeriod` and `cac:EvidenceSupplied`).  

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-TCR-08, BR-TCR-04)

|*cac:ApplicablePeriod*
|Associated class
|0..1
|A class for the economic operator to specify the start date and the end-date when the expected answer to a criterion property is a lapse of time.
|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-018[_tbr92-018_]

*Rule*: The ESPD-EDM does only expect start date and end date. Software applications may take leverage of the richness of this class though for other purposes beyond the scope of this specification.

|*cac:EvidenceSupplied*
|Associated class
|0..1
|A reference to the evidence supporting this criterion property response.
|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-017[_tbr92-017_]

*Rule*: Used to point at an instance of the cac:Evidence.

|===

.Disjointness of the elements inside cac:ResponseValue
[NOTE]
====
*Beware* that *one* `cac:ResponseValue` element contains the complete list of possible values for *one* answer to a criterion property. Only one *type* of element can be used to answer a criterion property, and that element MUST be of the same type as the one specified as expected in the ESPD Request (element `cac:TenderingCriterionProperty/cac:ValueDataTypeCode`). 

Thus, for example, if in the ESPD Request the expected type is DESCRIPTION the cac:ResponseValue must use the element `cbc:Description`, if INDICATOR `cbc:ResponseIndicator`, if IDENTIFIER `cbc:ResponseID`, etc. 

See the codes used for `cac:ValueDataTypeCode` in the Code List link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.0.2.ods[ResponseDataType]. For the different possible values in the response see the XSD diagrams above and the list of the expected elements in `cac:ResponseValue` in the table below.

This disjointness rule applies to the *type* of the value, but *not to the values of the same type*. Thus, for lists of values that constitute the actual answer (e.g. the list of LotIDs the economic operator tenders to, or a list of CPV codes to describe with granularity an activity), a sequence of `cac:ResponseValues` shall be instantiated in the XML. See the XML examples below.

The table below lists the elements expected in the sub-class `cac:ResponseValue`. Remember that the elements of distinct types are all *disjoint* amongst themselves: i.e. you cannot associate one amount AND one indicator to the same `cac:TenderingCriterionProperty` element  (but several values for elements of one type may be used to build up lists, e.g. lists of Lots and lists of CPV codes).

Up to three different types of Quantities can be specified: (1) QUANTITY_INTEGER, a number representing a quantity in a specific unit of measure. The unit has to be specified (e.g. number of workers); (2) QUANTITY_YEAR, a non-negative integer (i.e. a natural number) representing a year. The unit has to be specified as YEAR, and (3) QUANTITY, a number representing a generic quantity with no unit specified (e.g. a ratio).
