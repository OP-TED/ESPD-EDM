The ESPD Exchange Data Model (ESPD-EDM) is flexible enough so as to implement XML documents with different structures. Concretely, the 
possibility of nesting groups of requirements inside groups of requirements can end up in complex XML instances that may not resemble
amongst them thus hindering the mapping of data, their presentation and the interoperability between systems.

Hence the need of establishing of a minimum set of rules about how to build up such data structures. To keep conformance with
the ESPD Services the rules are simple:

.General rule 2: How to structure an ESPD Service Criterion
[NOTE]
====
[.text-left]
. Respect the structure proposed by the ESPD Service for each Criterion, as shown in this document or as in the XML structures of
the documents exported by the ESPD Service. For the time being these structures are fixed (immutable). In future releases of the 
ESPD Service the structures will be "dynamic"  and will map the criteria as defined in e-Certis2;
. Reserve the first requirement of a group to ask a question for which the response MUST be "Yes" or "No".
. Use the attribute `pi` of the `RequirementGroup` element to set whether the ESPD Service MUST take into account the content 
of the group or not. The ESPD Service accepts three possibilities: 
	* *GROUP_FULFILLED.ON_TRUE* means that the requirement group which contains this attribute value is displayed when, in the response, 
	the corresponding INDICATOR is set to 'Yes' (set to true). This is the case for all the Exclusion criteria.
	* *GROUP_FULFILLED.ON_FALSE* the requirement group which contains this attribute value is displayed when its corresponding indicator 
	is set to 'No' (set to false). See examples amongst the Selection criteria.
	* If it is missing then the requirement group will always be displayed

The flow-chart below illustrates this principle for any exclusion conviction criterion:

The interpretation of this diagram could be as as follows:

[.text-left]
* This criterion has two main groups of requirements  (G1: _Breach?_ and G2: _Online Evidence_);
* The first group of requirements has one requirement and one sub-group or requirements;
* If the response to the requirement is "Yes" (ON TRUE footnote:[In the XML this is the attribute `GROUP_FULFILLED.ON_TRUE` of the element `RequirementGroup`]) 
then the ESPD Service application will show four data fields and a new subgroup with an additional question. Thus (on True) the EO will have to provide the date of the conviction, 
the reason, who was convicted and for how long.  If the response is "No", then the EO will proceed providing data about whether there's online evidence or not 
regarding to the absence of conviction (if that is possible).
* This behaviour repeats per each subgroup of requirements: the deepest subgroup of the structure for the group 1 will have to be shown by the ESPD Service (and filled by the EO) in case an
imported ESPDRequirement XML has a "Yes" in the response to the requirement _Self-Cleaning_.

In the next sections this principle is used to structure the Exclusion and Selection Criteria. See also the examples provided all along the document.
