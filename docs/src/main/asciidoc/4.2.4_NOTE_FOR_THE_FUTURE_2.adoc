.Note for the future 2: Cross-border/cross-sector codes
[IMPORTANT]
====
Some relevant trans-European initiatives like ECRIS, BRIS, EESSI, and other, have defined Code Lists and other reference data that could be used in e-Procurement, and specifically 
by the ESPD. This would enhance the cross-border and cross-sector semantic and technical interoperability.
 
Thus, in the case of Convictions, a new requirement could be introduced in G1 (see figures above) asking for the ECRIS Code corresponding to the offence that will be specified in 
the Response in case the Economic Operator answered ''yes'' to the first Requirement. The ECRIS Codes can be consulted in the Annex to the COUNCIL DECISION 2009/316/JHA of 6 April 
2009 on the establishment of the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) in application of Article 11 of Framework Decision 2009/315/JHA.footnote:[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009D0316].
