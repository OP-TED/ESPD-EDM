=== Service Provider

The Service Provider refers to the party who provided the data included in the ESPDRequest XML document. For this purpose the ESPD EDM reuses 
the UBL-2.1 class `cac:ServiceProvider`, which ''is a'' `cac:Party` class.  (see the http://docs.oasis-open.org/ubl/UBL-2.1.html[UBL-2.1 specification] for details about this class).
