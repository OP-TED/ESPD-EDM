=== IX.2 All about weights

The *SELF-CONTAINED ESPD*  caters for two methods of evaluating criteria (the REGULATED ESP does not covers this aspect).
These two methods are identified in the code list
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/master/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.0.2.xlsx[EvaluationMethodType] as
1) PASSFAIL (Pass or fail), and 2) WEIGHTED (the criterion is assigned a weight).

The ''pass or fail'' method is used in open procedures and in the first stage of multi-staged procedures. In multi-staged
procedures, once the list of candidates meeting the criteria have been selected, it makes sense to evaluate their tenders
based on weighted selection criteria.

Hence the following general rule should be applied by software applications dealing with the ESPD-EDM:

. If the procedure is open 1) no reduction of candidates is possible, and 2) criteria will not be weighted
(the value of the element cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode is to be set to `PASSFAIL`);

. Otherwise 1) the contracting authority should have the possibility of specifying the criteria and rules to be applied
in order to limit the number of candidates, and 2) it should have the possibility of assigning a weight to any selection
criterion (the value of the element cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode is to be set to `WEIGHTED`);

==== Information requirement check-list

. Only in *SELF-CONTAINED* ESPD-Request and ESDP-Response documents
. Only in multi-staged procedures
. The need for weighting was identified only for these Selection criteria (although the data model caters for
weighing any criterion):

    ** *Abilities I (Persons)*

    *** Criterion #40 - Technicians or technical bodies for quality control
    *** Criterion #41 - For works contracts: technicians or technical bodies to carry out the work

    ** *Abilities II (Facilities, etc.)*

    *** Criterion #42 - Technical facilities and measures for ensuring quality
    *** Criterion #43 - Study and research facilities
    *** Criterion #44 - Supply chain management
    *** Criterion #45 - Environmental management measures
    *** Criterion #46 - Tools, plant or technical equipment

    ** Abilities III (Education)

    *** Criterion #47 - Educational and professional qualifications

.Order of occurrence of the different blocks of data related to weights
[cols="<1,<1,<2,<2,<2"]
|===
|*Nº*|*Data Element*|*Description*|*Location*|*Rules*
|1
|*The weighting methodology*
|Method that will be used to select those selection criteria that will be weighted (used for transparency purposes)
|Element `cbc:WeightScoringMethodologyNote`, at the root of the Qualification Application Request document (see section
link:#iii-4-root-elements[III.4 Root elements], see also the UBL-2.2 Schema for the Qualification Application Request
(the link:#iii-the-espd-request-document[ESPD-Request document])
|The economic operators should be informed in detail about how the selection will be performed

|2
|*The numeric weighting type*
|The expression method for the weighting of the selection criteria (numeric, percentage).
|Element `cbc:WeightingTypeCode`, at the root of the Qualification Application Request document
|The numeric can also be used to express percentages (in the form of ''0.x''). See also the code list
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.1.1.xlsx[EvaluationMethodType]

|3
|*The criterion weight value*
|The concrete value assigned by the CA to the criterion for its weighting at evaluation time (e.g. 10%)
|Element `cbc:WeightNumeric`, inside the `cac:TenderingCriterion` class
(see section link:#iv-1-general-behavior[IV. Criteria, common aspects /IV.1 General behavior]
|None

|4
|*The criterion evaluation method type*
|To inform that the criterion will be weighted (WEIGHTED vs PASSFAIL). See code list
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.1.1.xlsx[EvaluationMethodType]
|Element `cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode`, inside the `cac:TenderingCriterion` class (see section
link:#iv-1-general-behavior[IV. Criteria, common aspects /IV.1 General behavior]
|The weight is used in second (or subsequent) stages of the evaluation. The first stage is always a PASSFAIL selection,
even if the code WEIGHTED is assigned to this element

|5
|*Criterion-specific evaluation approach*
|Explanation about how this specific criterion is weighted and will be evaluated (for transparency purposes)
|Element `cbc:WeightingConsiderationDescription`, inside the `cac:TenderingCriterion` class (see section
link:#iv-1-general-behavior[IV. Criteria, common aspects /IV.1 General behavior]
|

|6
|*REQUIREMENT(s) in the criterion*
|Criteria that are weighted carry a specific REQUIREMENT stating that ''This criterion will be weighted''
|Elements `cac:TenderingCriterion` (see the figure on the data structure and the XML example,below)
|*BEWARE* that the REQUIREMENT ''This criterion will be weighted'' is redundant with the element
`cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode`, which may cause inconsistency. Therefore try and do not use this
REQUIREMENT ''This criterion will be weighted'' and use instead the `cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode`. If you do not
use this REQUIREMENT then you have to replace it with a CAPTION, because the cardinality constraint imposed
by the UBL-2.2 requires that the first element inside a group or subgroup is a `cac:TenderingCriterionProperty` it in the XSD schema.

|===

The figure below shows elements 1 and 2 in the UBL-2.2 XSD Schema:

.Elements related to the weight at the root level of the document
image::ESPD-Response-WeightingRootElements.png[Root elements related to criterion weighting, alt="Root elements related to criterion weighting", align="center"]

This other figure shows the elements inside the class Criterion:

.Elements related to the weight inside the 'cac:TenderingCriterion' class
image::Criterion-weight-related-data_elements.png[Weight-related data elements, alt="Weight-related data elements", align="center"]

===== Mock-up - contracting authority perspective

The mock-up below illustrates how the contracting authority may specify weighted criteria.

.Self-contained 'Abilities (I)' WEIGHTED CA REQUIREMENT edition mock-up
image::Selfcontained_Abilities_WEIGHTED_CA_REQ_mockup.png[Self-contained 'Abilities (I)' WEIGHTED CA REQUIREMENT edition mock-up, alt="Self-contained 'Abilities (I)' WEIGHTED CA REQUIREMENT edition mock-up", align="center"]

Notice that:

. The field ''One or more criteria will be weighted'' is not stored in the data model;
. The field ''Criterion weighting type'' is generic to all the criteria and is placed in the element `cbc:WeightingTypeCode` (element #2 in the table above);
. The field ''Provide the general method used to score and evaluate the weighted criteria" is hold in the element `cbc:WeightScoringMethodologyNote`;
and is also generic for all the weighted criteria (element #1 in the table above);
. The CA has chosen ''WEIGHTED'' as the value for the combo box labeled 'Criterion evaluation method'  and for the specific
criterion ''For contracts: technicians or technical bodies to carry out the work'' (element #4 in the table above);
. The weight assigned by the contracting authority (CA) to this criterion is `0.1`. This value will be placed in the the
element `cbc:WeightNumeric` (element #3 in the table above);
. The additional information about how this specific criterion will be evaluated will be place in the element
`cbc:WeightingConsiderationDescription` (element #5 in the table above).

===== Mock-up - economic operator perspective

This mock-up illustrates how all the information specified by the contracting authority (CA), concerning
1) the generic information about weights, and 2) the information specific of the criterion may be
presented to the economic operator (EO):

.Self-contained 'Abilities (I)' WEIGHTED EO mock-up
image::Selfcontained_Abilities_WEIGHTED_EO_mockup2.png[Self-contained 'Abilities (I)' WEIGHTED EO mock-up, alt="Self-contained 'Abilities (I)' WEIGHTED EO mock-up", align="center"]

===== Criterion data structure

The following data structure represents the structure of one of the selection criteria that may be weighted in multi-stage
procedures (''Technicians or technical bodies for quality control'').

*Beware* that:

* The fact that the criterion will be weighted is indicated by the REQUIREMENT ''This criterion will be weighted'';
* This REQUIREMENT can be replaced by a CAPTION
* The purpose of this REQUIREMENT can be fulfilled using the element `cbc:EvaluationMethodTypeCode`

ESPD Request document.
