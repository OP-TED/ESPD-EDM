|*cbc:UBLVersionID*
|Identifier
|1
|Identifies the earliest version of the UBL 2 schema for this document type that defines all of the elements that might be encountered in the current instance.
|*Information Requirement*: 
http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-020[_tbr92-020_]. 

*Rule*: Use the value "2.2". Use also "OASIS-UBL-TC" for the schemeAgencyID attribute. 

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-05, 2.BR-OTH-02)

|*cbc:CustomizationID*
|Identifier
|1
|Identifies a user-defined customization of UBL for a specific use.
|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-019[_tbr92-019_].

*Rule*: For the ESPD we use the value “urn:www.cenbii.eu:transaction:biitrdm092:ver3.0”. Compulsory use of the value "CEN-BII" for the schemeAgencyID attribute. 

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-02, BR-OTH-06)

|*cbc:ProfileID*
|Identifier
|0..1
|An identification of the specification containing the total set of rules regarding semantic content, cardinalities and business rules to which the data contained in the instance document conforms. The identification may include the version of the specification as well as any customizations applied.
|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-019[_tbr92-019_].

*Rule*: Use the value "41". Use also "CEN-BII" for the scheme AgencyID attribute. 

*Rule scope*: Common (BR-OTH-07, BR-OTH-02)

|*cbc:ID*
|Identifier
|1
|An identifier for this document, normally generated by the system that creates the ESPD document, or the organisation responsible for the document (e.g. the buyer, e.g. a contracting authority, or the supplier, e.g. an economic operator). The identifier enables positive referencing the document instance for various purposes including referencing between transactions that are part of the same process.

|*Information Requirement*: http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr92-019[_tbr92-019_].

*Rule*: It is a good practice to use the CopyIndicator component if the same document is forwarded several times to the same or to different destinations. Use it in combination with the UUID identifier: copies of an ESPD document should be identified with distinct UUIDs.

|*cbc:UUID*

*Rule*: Other documents, e.g. the tender, might refer to the ESPD Response using this identifier (thus its compulsoriness). Copies of a document must be identified with a different UUID. Compulsory use of schemeAgencyID attribute.

|*cbc:ContractFolderID*
|Identifier
|1
|An identifier that is specified by the buyer and used as a reference number for all documents in the procurement process. It is also known as procurement project identifier, procurement reference number or contract folder identifier. A reference to the procurement procedure to which a Qualification request document and the delivered response documents are associated.
