=== III.4 Root elements

The table below lists the elements that are expected in the ESPD Response V2.1.0 and provides details on the cardinalities and usage of those elements.

.A note about the Business Rules identifiers
[IMPORTANT]
====
From this point on in the document, the tables defining classes and its properties refer frequently to business rules. 
As stated in the link:http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-BusinessRules[e-Sens BIS document],
"[..] business rules are sets of rules that clarify the content of instances by stating mandatory fields, fixed values (like code lists), dependency
between fields in the same object and dependency between different objects".

If you need to well understand where the business rules come from and how they are implemented and executed you should read the following content in the order indicated:

. The http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-BusinessRules[ESPDint BIS document, Chapter Business Rules], where the rules are described in a
narrative way, from the business perspective; 
. The link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/doc/ESPD_TestCases.docx[ESPD Test Cases], where the ESPDint BIS rules are connected to each
class and data element of the XML implementation Guide and "Test Cases" are defined as a previous step towards the specification of machine-readable rules (based on ISO-Schematron, see link:#annex-i-xml-validation[Annex I: XML Validation];   
. The link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.0/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/doc/ESPD_TestCases_mapping.docx[ESPD Test Cases Mapping], where every business rule (previously identified and describe in the other two documents) is mapped
to specific elements of the ESPD XSD Schemas, the severity of the error is indicate, the text of the validation-result message for the validation report, etc.;
|*Information requirement*: 

Beware that *all theses documents do share the same business rule identifiers* (e.g. tbrxx-yyy for Business Requirement Identifiers in ESPDInt, and BR-Type-Id#n for the Test Cases technical rules).

An identifier for this document, normally generated by the system that creates the ESPD document, or the organisation responsible for the document (e.g. the buyer, e.g. a contracting authority, or the supplier, e.g. an economic operator). The identifier enables positive referencing the document instance for various purposes including referencing between transactions that are part of the same process.

|*Information Requirement*:

*Rule*: It is a good practice to use the CopyIndicator component if the same document is forwarded several times to the same or to different destinations. Use it in combination with the UUID identifier: copies of an ESPD document should be identified with distinct UUIDs.

The REGULATED version should not contain a `cac:ProcurementProject` in order to ensure the back-wards compatibility with the version 1.0.2.
