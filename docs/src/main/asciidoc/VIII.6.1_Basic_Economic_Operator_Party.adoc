==== Mock-ups and data structures

The mock-up below shows the set of data required about the economic operator for the *Basic* model of the ESPD:

*Mock-up (1/8): Basic identification data*:

The following figures below show the data aimed at other purposes (namely statistical), that is structured using the UBL-2.2 `cac:TenderingCriterion`. See the XML example below to check how both, the `cac:EconomicOperatorParty` and these data structures are used.

*Mockup (2/8): Sheltered workshop or social business in case of reserved procurement*:

.Sheltered workshop or social business - mock-up

*Data structure for a sheltered workshop or social business in case of reserved procurement*:

*Mockup (3/8): Registration on an official list, tenderer register or (pre)qualification system*:

*Data structure for the (pre)qualification of the economic operator by an official list or similar*:

.Prequalification-related data structure

*Mock-up (4/8): Role and other members of the group*:

*Data structure for the role and members of the group (when bidding as a Consortium, Joint Venture, etc.)* Beware that the name of the group has its own placeholder in the UBL-2.2 data model: `/QualificationApplicationResponse/cbc:EconomicOperatorGroupName`

*Mock-up(6/8): Certificates about contributions to the Tax Agency and/or Social Security*:

.Contributions certificates

*Mock-up (7/8): Entities on which the economic operator relies on to meet the selection criteria. Notice only a *Yes* or *No* answer is expected:

.Entities upon which the EO relies on, mock-up 
image::Basic_EO_Relied_On_entities.png[Entities upon which the EO relies on, mock-up, alt="Entities upon which the EO relies on, mock-up", align="center"]

*Data structure for the entities the EO relies on*:

.Entities relied on - data structure

*Mock-up: (8/8): Entities on which the economic operator does not rely on to meet the selection criteria. Notice only a *Yes* or *No* answer is expected, plus a sequence of entity names as a text:

.Entities upon which the EO does not rely on, mock-up 
image::Basic_EO_NOT_Relied_On_entities.png[Entities upon which the EO does not rely on - mock-up, alt="Entities upon which the EO does not rely on - mock-up", align="center"]

*Data structure for the subcontractor upon which the EO does not relied to meet the selection criteria*:
