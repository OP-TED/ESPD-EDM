
=== III.10 Lots - Regulated ESPD

[cols="<1,<4"]
|===
|*REQUIREMENT*
|At least one Lot must be always instantiated in the Regulated ESPD XML document. If the procurement procedure is not divided into Lots the only lot present in the Regulated ESPD XML document represents the procedure, and its Identifier value must be '0'. 
|===

The Regulated ESPD does not cater for the specification of Lots. It only expects one Lot representing the procurement procedure.
 
==== Mock-up
(No need for a mock-up, as no Lots are expected).

==== XSD Schema
