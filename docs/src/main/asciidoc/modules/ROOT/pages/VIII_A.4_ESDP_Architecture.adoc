=== ESPD Validation Architecture

The validation of a ESPD XML has the following life-cycle:

. The validation of the XML starts by ensuring that the input XML follows the *structure defined by the XSD*: QualificationApplicationRequest.xsd XSD Schema or QualificationApplicationResponse.xsd XSD Schema. These schemas can be found under the folder dist/xsdrt/maindoc (or the equivalent documented xsd folder).

.. If the validation of the structure is not successful, the process stops and sends the report with the list of errors.

.. If the validation of the structure is successful, the process continues with the code list validations and business rules. All errors found (if any) are listed in the report.


. Depending on the type of application (ESPD Request or ESPD Response), and independently of the qualification application type code (either regulated or self-contained), different types of validations are executed:

==== ESDP Request (Regulated or Self-contained)

. *XSD Validation* against UBL-QualificationApplicationRequest-2.2-Pre-award.xsd

. *Code list validations*. These are common for both, Request and Response:
.. Validation of the code list values: 01 ESPD-codelist-values.cva
.. Validation of the identification of the code list: 01 ESPD Common CL Attributes.sch

. Business rules related to the *cardinality* of the schema, that cannot be controlled using the XSD: 02 ESPD Req Cardinality BR.sch

. Business rules used to validate the *criteria taxonomy*:
.. Validations common for Request and Response: 03 ESPD Common Criterion BR.sch
.. Validations specific for Request applications: 03 ESPD Req Criterion BR.sch

. *Other* business rules:
.. Other validations which are common to Request and Response applications, such as the mandatory use of the attribute schemeAgencyID for identifiers: 04 ESPD Common Other BR.sch
.. Specific business rules for Request applications, in this case, the validation of the correct value for cbc:CutomisationID element: 04 ESPD Req Other BR.sch
.. Business rules related to the procurer: 05 ESPD Req Procurer BR.sch
.. Specific business rules for Self-contained application type: 05 ESPD Req Self-contained BR.sch


==== ESDP Response

. *XSD Validation* against UBL-QualificationApplicationResponse-2.2-Pre-award.xsd

. *Code list validations*. These are common for both, Request and Response:
.. Validation of the code list values: 01 ESPD-codelist-values.cva
.. Validation of the identification of the code list: 01 ESPD Common CL Attributes.sch

. Business rules related to the *cardinality* of the schema, that cannot be controlled using the XSD: 02 ESPD Resp Cardinality BR.sch.sch

. Business rules used to validate the *criteria taxonomy*:
.. Validations common for Request and Response: 03 ESPD Common Criterion BR.sch
.. Validations specific for Response applications: 03 ESPD Resp Criterion BR.sch

. *Other* business rules:
.. Other validations which are common to Request and Response applications, such as the mandatory use of the attribute schemeAgencyID for identifiers: 04 ESPD Common Other BR.sch
.. Specific business rules for Response applications, in this case, the validation of the correct value for cbc:CutomisationID element: 04 ESPD Resp Other BR.sch
.. Business rules related to the economic operator: 05 ESPD Resp EO BR.sch
.. Specific business rules for Self-contained application type: 05 ESPD Resp Self-contained BR.sch
.. Specific business rules for economic operators registered in a pre-qualification system: 05 ESPD Resp Qualification BR.sch
.. Specific business rules depending on the role: 05 ESPD Resp Role BR.sch
