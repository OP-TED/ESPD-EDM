*Rule*: For the ESPD we use the value “urn:www.cenbii.eu:transaction:biitrdm070:ver3.0”. Compulsory use of the value "CEN-BII" for the schemeAgencyID attribute. 

|*cbc:ProfileID*
|Identifier
|0..1

|*cbc:ID*
|Identifier
|1
|An identifier for this document, normally generated by the system that creates the ESPD document, or the organisation responsible for the document (e.g. the buyer, e.g. a contracting authority, or the supplier, e.g. an economic operator). An identifier for this document, normally generated by the system that creates the ESPD document, or the organisation responsible for the document (e.g. the buyer, e.g. a contracting authority, or the supplier, e.g. an economic operator). The identifier enables positive referencing the document instance for various purposes including referencing between transactions that are part of the same process.

|*Information Requirement*: 
http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.0-tbr070-002[_tbr070-002_].
