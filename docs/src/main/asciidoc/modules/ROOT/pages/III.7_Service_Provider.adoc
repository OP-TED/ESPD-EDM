|*The ESPD request may contain information of identification regarding an ESPD service provider: Name, Party Identification, Endpoint ID.*

Service providers are officially recognised organisations that can supply ESPD Request documents (on behalf of the contracting body) with pre-filled information about the contracting body and additional information (e.g. liability statements, see http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/display/ESPDInt/BIS+41+-+ESPD+V2.1.0#BIS41-ESPDV2.1.0-tbr070-012[_tbr070-012_])

The ESPD allows the provision of data about the service provider who produced the ESPD Request document (and equally for the ESPD Response document, on behalf of the economic operator).

Since the 2.1.0 version, and unlike to the previous version 1.0.2, the ESPD-EDM, including the current version 2.1.1 does not include the `cac:ServiceProvider` as a 'document root component'. Instead, it uses the UBL-2.2 `cac:ContractingParty/cac:Party` associated class `cac:ServiceProviderParty`.

*Notice that*:

. The `cac:Party` class aggregates the class `cac:ServiceProviderParty`; and 

. The `cac:ServiceProviderParty` class 'is a' Party. Hence it aggregates a `cac:Party` class too, and uses it to place the main data about the service provider (like name, address, end-point, etc.).
