==== Certificates

The criteria under the category ''Certificates'' use two groups of data structure. However the categorisation of the 
certificates (in the Criteria Taxonomy) has been split in three different categories of the certificates:  

	* CRITERION.SELECTION.TECHNICAL_PROFESSIONAL_ABILITY.CERTIFICATES.QUALITY_ASSURANCE.QA_INSTITUTES: ''For supply contracts: certificates by quality control institutes''.
	 
	* CRITERION.SELECTION.TECHNICAL_PROFESSIONAL_ABILITY.CERTIFICATES.QUALITY_ASSURANCE.QA_INDEPENDENT: ''For certificates by independent bodies about quality assurance standards''.
	
	* CRITERION.SELECTION.TECHNICAL_PROFESSIONAL_ABILITY.CERTIFICATES.ENVIRONMENTAL_MANAGEMENT.*: ''Certificates by independent bodies about environmental management systems or standards''.
