
=== III.2 ESPD Request XSD Schema

The ESPD-EDM V2.0.2 uses the UBL-2.2 document named `QualificationApplicationRequest.xsd` XSD Schema. This schema can be found under the folder link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.0.2/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/xsdrt/maindoc[dist/xsdrt/maindoc] (or the equivalent documented `xsd` folder).

The figure below shows the XSD Schema defined by UBL-2.2 for the document “Qualification Application Request”. This schema replaces the Schema for the “ESPD Request” document used in the previous versions of the ESPD-EDM.

The figure below shows a diagram representing the UBL-2.2 XSD Schema. Only the first level components of the schema are shown. The inner sub-elements and sub-classes are covered in  detail in the following sub-sections of this document.
