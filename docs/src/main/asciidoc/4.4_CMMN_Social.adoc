	environmental law'', ''breaching of obligations in the fields of social law'' 
	and ''breaching of obligations in the fields of labour law''.

	* This same structure is also used for other exclusion criteria such as the misconduct related ones or one particular case of conflict of interest;
	* Contrary to the criteria so far studied this one does not include the group of requirements requesting evidences (see also [DOC-REF-1]).
