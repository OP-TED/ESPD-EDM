==== Turnovers

The group of criteria relating to turnovers is somehow special in the sense that it introduces a kind of 
''iterative structure'' that the criteria studied so far does not implement. As illustrated in the 
figures and example below, this iterative structure for turnovers allows repeating a specific tuple
footnote:[i.e. a couple of values corresponding to amount and year.] of amount and year as many 
times as required in the specific call for tender (normally values for the past three years).

The simplified data structure illustrates this idea of iterative tuples (Year, Amount). The ''...'' symbol means that the subgroup is repeated as many times as required in the tender documents:
The corresponding data-structure diagram would be this one. Notice that each tuple (Year, Amount) is treated as a subgroup of two requirements:
