
=== VI.11 Subcontracting proportion

==== Related information requirements

See formal requirements related to selection criteria in the http://wiki.ds.unipi.gr/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=44367916[BIS 41 - European Single Procurement Document (Version 2.0.0)].

==== Differences between Regulated and Self-contained

. For this criterion, the only difference between the *REGULATED* and *SELF-CONTAINED* versions lies in the fact that the *SELF-CONTAINED* XML instance is able to keep national sub-criteria defined by the Member State in e-Certis.

. For both versions, *REGULATED* and *SELF-CONTAINED*, there is only one criterion with a simple data structure, classified as:

	** CRITERION.SELECTION.TECHNICAL_PROFESSIONAL_ABILITY.MANAGEMENT.SUBCONTRACTING_PROPORTION

==== Mock-ups - contracting authority perspective (*REGULATED* and *SELF-CONTAINED*)

The contracting authority selects the criterion to be included in the ESPD Request:

.'Subcontracting proportion' CA mock-up (REGULATED and SELF-CONTAINED) 
image::Subcontracting_CA_mockup.png['Subcontracting proportion' CA mock-up, alt="'Subcontracting proportion' CA mock-up", align="center"]

==== Mock-ups - economic operator perspective (*REGULATED* and *SELF-CONTAINED*)

The economic operator has to provide a descriptive response in a free-text field:

.'Subcontracting proportion' EO mock-up (*REGULATED* and *SELF-CONTAINED*)

==== Data Structure - Regulated

The data structure is very simple, it only defines a group with one QUESTION:

(Some columns have been hidden to enhance the readability of the image).

image::Regulated_Subcontracting_Data_Structure.png[Regulated 'Subcontracting proportion' criterion data structure, alt="Regulated 'Subcontracting proportion' criterion data structure",align="center"]

==== Data Structure - Self-contained

The difference with the *Regulated* version is that the *Self-contained* is able to define and keep in the XML instance the national sub-criteria. But, as sub-criteria are optional, if the MS did not defined any national sub-criterion then the data structure would enn up being the same than for both cases.

image::Selfcontained_Subcontracting_Data_Structure.png[Self-contained 'Subcontracting proportion' criterion data structure, alt="Self-contained 'Subcontracting proportion' criterion data structure",align="center"]

==== XML Example - (*REGULATED* and *SELF-CONTAINED*)

As in this case the MS (Finland, in this example), did not defined any national criterion associated to the EU criterion, the resulting XML instance is identical for both versions of the ESPD Request (Regulated and Self-contained).
