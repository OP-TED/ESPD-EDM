=== Economic Operator 

The ESPResponse was explicitly designed to hold data about one single Economic Operator.
Thus, the ESPDResponse Exchange Data Model associates a class `EconomicOperatorParty` as 
a placeholder for the data related to only one Economic Operator (EO) that 
tenders solely to a procurement project, to one of the EOs that tender as part of a group 
(e.g. a Consortium), or to one possible sub-contractor of the EO. 

Consortia grouping more than one EO need to draft and submit as many ESPDResponses as Economic 
Operators and sub-contractors participate in the tender. 
Revisit the "Figure 7: espd::ESPDRequest UML class diagram" and check that its association
to the epsd::EconomicOperatorParty class is restricted to 1. This element is therefore mandatory.

The UML diagram below shows the details about the class EconomicOperatorParty:

==== EconomicOperatorParty
The table below lists the attributes and associated classes expected in an XML conformant to the ESPD Service. 
Beware that this class associates the very rich UBL-2.1 aggregate component `cac:Party`. 
Similarly to what happens with the `cac:ContractingParty`, the ESPDResponse `espd:EconomicOperatorParty`
only uses a reduced subset of the component `cac:Party`.
