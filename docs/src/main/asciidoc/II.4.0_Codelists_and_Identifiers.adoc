=== II.4 Codes and Identifiers

A code is a shortened way (a number or a short abbreviated text), leading to the definition of a 'concept'. The code epresents the concept and is used by software applications to retrieve the definition of the concept or make automatic decisions.

An Identifier, in turn, can be defined as “a value (represented as a short text, a number or a combination of both) used to establish the identity of, and distinguish uniquely, one occurrence of an object following a pattern” . 

The essential distinctive features between identifiers and codes are:

. Identifiers point at specific occurrences of objects (instances); codes replace concepts;

. Identifiers are virtually limitless while codes are finite. In other words, identifier lists are “open” (the lists may grow) and code list are “closed” (practically never updated, once consolidated). Hence codes are maintained in 'Codelists' whilst identifiers are usually kept in databases.

. Identifiers are in principle maintained in the business domain, e.g. buyer identifiers, economic operator identifiers, exclusion or selection criteria identifiers, etc.

. Codes may belong to three different domains: 

.. they can be somehow 'business-agnostic' and be used cross-domain (e.g. country codes, currency codes, language codes, etc.); 

.. business-specific domain (i.e. procurement specific, like codes representing contract types, procurement procedure types, criteria types, etc.); and 

.. business process-specific, i.e. ESPD-specific, such as the data type expected in the response to a criterion, or the type of a criterion property, etc.

==== Codes and code lists

The ESPD Exchange Data Model tries to reuse as much as possible the codes that are already used for e-Procurement. In any project, like the ESPD-EDM,
there are at least three types (or layers) of codes:

. *Cross-sector*, common, codes, like the ones defined and maintained by the ISO for currencies, languages, countries, etc.; or the ones defined by the European Commission
that can be used in multiple business domains, e.g. the NUTS defined by EUROSTAT; the ones defined by BACH (Banque de France), etc.;
. *Business domain-related*, maintained by international or European authorities, e.g. the ones defined by UNECE (as unit codes), or by the Publications Office of the European Union (OP), e.g. types of procurement procedures (based on the EU Directives);
. *Project-specific* (or application-specific), i.e. those codes that are particular of the project. Types (taxonomy) of exclusion and selection criteria, types of evaluation method, etc. in the case of the ESPD-EDM.

Codes are normally maintained in "code lists". The ESPD-EDM keeps and distributes these code lists in three different formats:

. In an Office Open XML (link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.1.1.xlsx[XLSX]) file,
. In an Open Office Document (link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/ods[ODS]) file,
. Genericode 1.0 (link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/gc[GC]) files (one `*.gc` file per code list).

ESPD-EDM Code list contain the following elements:

* *Metadata*: information about the code list, e.g. its identifier, the identifier and name of the agency responsible for defining and maintaining the list, the version of the list, etc.
* *Code identifier*: the literal (a label composed of characters, numbers and symbols like '_');
* *Concept description*: the definition of the concept represented by the code;
* *Multilingual descriptions*: the translations of the English definitions.

The figure below illustrate how these elements are organised in the code lists maintained in spread-sheets:
