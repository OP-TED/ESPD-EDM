The category ''Misconduct'' encompasses two criteria that share the same structure as the one used for the ''social'' group of criteria (see sub-section 
''How to specify ''social'' related criteria, above).footnote:[See &#91;DOC-REF-8&#93; for the complete taxonomy of criteria and each criterion code label.]

	* CRITERION.EXCLUSION.MISCONDUCT.*: ''guilty of grave professional misconduct''; and ''agreements with other economic operators aimed at distorting competition''.
