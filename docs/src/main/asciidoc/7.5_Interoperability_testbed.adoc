=== 7.5 Interoperability testbed

The European Commission (EC) link:https://ec.europa.eu/isa2/awards_en[ISA2 Programme] provides an link:https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/itb/description[Interoperability Testbed] where Stakeholders can freely test these validation artefacts.

All the ESPD-EDM artefacts necessary to perform the validation are set up in the testbed. Thus developers and integrators can test the validity of the ESPD-Request and ESDP-Response XML instances by uploading the instances in the testbed and launching the validation.

Use this URL to upload and execute the validations: link:https://www.itb.ec.europa.eu/espd/upload[Upload].
