==== XML Example

This fragment of XML shows how the compulsory attributes are used for the some of the root elements of an ESPD Request document.

<1> The Agency responsible for the maintenance of the UBL versioning is the OASIS UBL Technical Committee
<2> The identifier for this document was issued by the a Spanish Central Government Directorate identified as 'DGPE'
<3> The UUID follows the ISO/IEC Scheme 9834-8:2008 Version 4 and was generated by the European Commission's Directorate General GROWTH (DG GROW)
<4> The reference number used to identify to which procurement procedure this ESPD document belongs (PP.20170419.1024-9) has been supplied by the Spanish Directorate DGPE
<5> Generic information, such as the content version ID, use always by default the "EU-COM-GROW" Agnecy ID. Notice that the other additional attributes may be also used, as in this example.
<6> Notice that for Codes, the three compulsory attributes are specified. For these codes. In this example the attributes are specifying that the code is maintained by the Publication Office in a list named `ProcedureType` and that the version that has been used is version `1.0` which is distributed jointly with this ESPD-EDM V2.1.1 specification (in the link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist[distribution package]).
<7> Beware that the codes may be numbers, text or combinations of both. These code labels are the ones that are specified in the codelist spreadsheets and XML Genericode files distributed jointly with this specification (in the folder `dist/cl` of the link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/tree/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist[distribution package].

==== Code list that *IS NOT* used for CODE values

Code lists contain the code identifiers that are expected as "values" for a data element of type CODE
(i.e. a UBL-2.2. cbc:CodeType element). This is case of code lists such as `CurrencyCode`, `CountryCodeIdentifier`,
`ProjectType`, `EORoleType`, etc.

However, this ESP-EDM specification also uses the code list
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.1.1.xlsx[EOIDType]
with a different purpose, "the identification of the type of scheme used to identify parties, namely Economic Operators"
(but should also used to identify the schemes used to identify Contracting Authorities, Service Providers, etc.).

The figure below shows the possible values of this code list.
These codes are to be used as values of the `schemeID` attribute (attribute of the UBL-2.2 element `cbc:Identifier`):

.Values of the schemeID for Party Identifiers

The next fragment of XML shows how this is used in the particular case of the Criterion "Relied on entities"
("Does the economic operator rely on the capacities of other entities in order to meet the selection criteria...?").
See also section link:#xml-example-extended-economic-operator[XML Example (Extended economic operator)]
for a more complete example on this Criterion:

.TenderingCriterionProperty (a QUESTION) asking for the identifier of the Economic Operator
[source,xml]

...

<cac:TenderingCriterionProperty>
    <cbc:ID schemeID="CriteriaTaxonomy" schemeAgencyID="EU-COM-GROW" schemeVersionID="2.1.1">1fa05728-308f-43b0-b547-c903ffb0a8af</cbc:ID><--1-->
    <cbc:Description>ID of the economic operator</cbc:Description>
    <cbc:TypeCode listID="CriterionElementType" listAgencyID="EU-COM-GROW" listVersionID="2.1.1">QUESTION</cbc:TypeCode>
    <cbc:ValueDataTypeCode listID="ResponseDataType" listAgencyID="EU-COM-GROW" listVersionID="2.1.1">ECONOMIC_OPERATOR_IDENTIFIER</cbc:ValueDataTypeCode><--2-->
</cac:TenderingCriterionProperty>

...
----
<1> The identifier of the property will be used in the response to map link the response to this QUESTION.
<2> The ECONOMIC_OPERATOR_IDENTIFIER is mapped to an element `cbc:ResponseID` in the response (which is based on the
UBL-2.2. element `cbc:Identifier`).

.TenderingCriterionResponse (the answer to the previous QUESTION)
[source,xml]
----
...

 <cac:TenderingCriterionResponse>
    <cbc:ID schemeID="ISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 - 4UUID" schemeAgencyID="EU-COM-GROW" schemeVersionID="2.1.1">acb58f0e-0fe4-4372-aa08-60d0c36bfcfe</cbc:ID>
    <cbc:ValidatedCriterionPropertyID schemeID="CriteriaTaxonomy" schemeAgencyID="EU-COM-GROW" schemeVersionID="2.1.1">1fa05728-308f-43b0-b547-c903ffb0a8af</cbc:ValidatedCriterionPropertyID><--1-->
    <cbc:ResponseID schemeID="VAT" schemeAgencyID="ES-AEAT">B82387770</cbc:ResponseID> <--2-->
 </cac:TenderingCriterionResponse>
...
----
<1> Notice that this UUID is identical to the QUESTION UUID, which is the mechanism used in UBL to link the answer to
the very specific QUESTION it is responding.
<2> The element `cbc:ResponseID` is of type `Identifier`(as defined in the Core Component Type Specification library).
The value ''VAT'' assigned to the attribute `schemeID`, taken from the code list
link:https://github.com/ESPD/ESPD-EDM/blob/2.1.1/docs/src/main/asciidoc/dist/cl/xlsx/ESPD-CodeLists-V2.1.1.xlsx[EOIDType],
is used to indicate that the type of identifier used is the Value Added Tax identifier issued by the Spanish Tax Agency (ES-AEAT).
