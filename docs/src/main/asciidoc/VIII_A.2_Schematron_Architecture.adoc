=== Schematron Architecture

ISO Schematron executes the validations in two stages:

. *Design and implementation of the SCH files*. 
SCH stands for Schematron Schema and contains the set of rules to be validated within the XML document.
. *Execution of the implemented validations* in the SCH files:
.. Transformation of SCH files into XSLT files in order to be able to execute the validations against the XML.
.. Execution of the validations using the XSLT files to get the final report.

==== What does SCH files contain?
. *Set of rules* specifying the context (the element(s) and/or attribute(s) which the assertions affect);
. Each rule have a *set of assertions* with the tests that must be evaluated in the context.

==== Execution

As a basis of the implementation, it has been taken into account:

. Schematron "skeleton" implementation in https://github.com/SCHEMATRON[XSLT].

This example describes the execution of the validation process using the http://saxon.sourceforge.net/[Saxon library] to execute XSLT files and the XSLT provided as a basis:
