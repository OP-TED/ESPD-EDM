This new version of the eESPD makes the difference between “basic” and “self-contained” ESPD. 

*Basic ESPDs* are those XML document instances the structure and content of which are strictly adjusted to the terms expressed in the Annex 2 of the http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0007[Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2016/7]: Standard form for the European Single Procurement document (ESPD). 

A *Basic ESPD* usually refers to documents and information that are external; i.e. it uses sentences like "mentioned in the Contract Notice published or the Contract Documents". The criteria of a Basic ESPD are all defined in eCertis and their structure never changes.

In a *Extended ESPD* all the information needed for an ESPD Request is either contained in other parts of the document or the document refers to the authentic online source from where to obtain it. Thus the criteria and requirements that are particular to the MS or to the contracting authority, generic to all Procurement Procedures or particular of the Procurement Procedure, are explicitly mentioned or defined in the ESPD Request document.

Additionally, in a *Extended ESPD* the Member State and the contracting authority are able to introduce requirements that are particular to the national legislation or the procurement procedure. Extended eESPDs confer the contracting authorities a greater flexibility when preparing their eESPD Request documents.

Thus, in the case of exclusion grounds, the Member States can define in eCertis national exclusion criteria and link them to the corresponding European criteria defined in the Directives.

In  the case of selection criteria, the contracting authority may introduce requirements for certain requirements (e.g. regarding turnovers, financial ratios, or references) to specify expected minimum amounts, specific types of ratios, minimum number of references, or other requirements).

This document provides descriptions about some of these situations, mock-ups and XML examples to illustrate the differences between Basic and Extended ESPDs and to clarify when and how to use them. 

See also section "III. The ESPD Request document" for details on how to specify the type of ESPD in an XML instance of an ESPD Request document.

==== Mock-up

Software applications need to be aware of this new feature introduced by the V2.1.0 of the ESPD-EDM. Depending on whether the ESPD Request document that is being prepared is basic or self-contained, a software application should behave in different ways; e.g. for Extended ESPD documents, the application should allow the contracting body to define requirements for some selection criteria that are specific to the procurement procedure.

One suggestion for a Graphical User Interface (GUI) aimed at editing ESPD Request documents is to facilitate the contracting body the selection  of the type of ESPD Request in an initial page:
